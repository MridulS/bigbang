Welcome to BigBang's documentation!
===================================

``BigBang`` is a toolkit for studying processes of open collaboration and
deliberation via analysis of the communications records.

BigBang is open source software hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/datactive/bigbang>`_.

It currently supports scraping public Sourceforge, Mailman, and ListServ mailing list archives and stores the results as Mbox or CSV files using Pythons mailbox and Pandas packages. A variety of modules for analysis and visualisation are provided to gain valuable insight from the obtained data.

Last but not least, BigBang is a community of researchers sharing code and best practices. BigBang comes with a large directory of `examples` showing how to use data science tools to study communications data. These examples are designed as tutorial and support data science and research pedagogy.
