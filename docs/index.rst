Welcome to BigBang's documentation!
===================================

``BigBang`` is a toolkit for studying processes of open collaboration and
deliberation via analysis of the communciations records.

It currently supports analyzing mailing lists from Sourceforge, Mailman,
ListServ or .mbox files.
BigBang provides tools for efficiently scraping this data
from on-line sources.

It also provides a variety of preprocessing scripts to assist researchers in gaining valuable insight from this data.

Last but not least, BigBang is a community of researchers sharing code and best practices. BigBang comes with a large directory of `examples` showing how to use data science tools to study communications data.
These examples are designed to support data science and communictions
research pedagogy.
