Data Access
*************

The mailing-list archives are large and time consuming to scrape from the web.
That is why we keep a complete and up-to-date copy of it in .mbox format that can easily 
be converted into other data structures to make its analysis as easy as possible.
If you would like to obtain access to these archives, we would ask you send us your 
filled in `data access permit application <https://github.com/datactive/bigbang/blob/master/data_access_permit_application.md>`_
to `bigbang-dev mailing list <hhttps://lists.ghserv.net/mailman/listinfo/bigbang-dev>`_.
