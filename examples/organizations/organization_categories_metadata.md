# 1. GENERAL INFORMATION
This table contains categorical information about stakeholders and subsidiaries that are active within the IETF and 3GPP.

In general, the 3GPP contains more fine-grained stakeholder compositions -- listing many more subsidiaries -- than the IETF. Therefore, if one is to use this data for the analysis of IETF mailing archives, we advise to merge all branches (subsidiaries, e.g., Ericsson Espa√±a S.A.) into the highest node (stakeholder, e.g., Ericsson) of the tree.

As some stakeholders or subsidiaries are active in multiple market sectors, they have associated to multiple categories, separating them with a comma.

As assigning such categories to stakeholders and subsidiaries is an inherently difficult endeavour we clearly state our objective here. The categories were assigned according to _____.

Something that we are thinking to follow up on in the future is to indicating whether the stakeholder or subsidiary has an ASN (Autonomous System Number; used for routing in the Internet), as it is not subject to debate and can be used to check for categories in other databases (eg, PeeringDB)

## Column E: nationality
The country name in which the stakeholder or subsidiary is registered.

## Column F: email domain names
The Email domains associated with each stakeholder and subsidiary is derived from the Email addresses used by members that contribute to the public mailing archives of the standard organisations listed in Column G. The association has been made by hand to ensure that no, e.g., personal or free available domain names (such as @gmail.com) are used. Sometimes multiple email domain names match the same stakeholder, in which case both are listed separated by a comma.
